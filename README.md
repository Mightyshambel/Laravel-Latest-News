# Laravel Blog Project

This is a simple blogging platform built with Laravel, based on the Laravel From Scratch series by Jeffrey Way. This project demonstrates the basics of a blogging platform and is fully functional for managing posts, authors, and comments.

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone git clone https://github.com/Mightyshambel/Laravel-Latest-News.git
cd Laravel-Latest-New
Step 2: Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install all necessary dependencies:
create a MySQL database for the project:
php artisan db
If the blog database doesn't already exist, create it manually in MySQL:
CREATE DATABASE blog;
Step 5: Run Migrations and Seeders
Run the migrations and seeders to populate the database:

php artisan migrate --seed
This will set up the necessary tables and initial data for your blogging platform.

Further Ideas and Enhancements
The project as it stands is a solid foundation for a blogging platform, but there are plenty of ways you can extend and improve it. Here are some ideas:

1. Add Post Status (Draft/Published)
Add a status column to the posts table to allow for posts that are still in a "draft" state. Only when the status is changed to "published" should posts appear in the blog feed.

2. Author Management
Update the "Edit Post" page in the admin section to allow for changing the author of a post.

3. Add RSS Feed
Implement an RSS feed that lists all posts in chronological order for easier syndication.

4. Track Post Views
Add a views_count column to the posts table to track and display how many times a post has been viewed.

5. Follow Authors
Allow registered users to "follow" certain authors. Whenever the followed authors publish a new post, an email notification should be sent to all followers.

6. Bookmarked Posts
Allow users to "bookmark" posts they enjoyed. Add a settings page where users can view their bookmarked posts.

7. Profile Management
Add an account page where users can update their username and upload an avatar for their profile.
